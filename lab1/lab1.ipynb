    "# Lab 1: Text Corpora and Language Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is meant to help you get familiar with some language data, and use this data to estimate N-gram language models\n",
    "\n",
    "First you will use the **Penn Treebank**, which is a collection of newspaper articles from the newspaper \n",
    "The Wall Street Journal. The idea is to examine the data and notice interesting properties. This will not take more than a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you will use a corpus consisting of **TedX** talks. This you will use to estimate an **N-gram language model** for different orders of N, and use this this for some tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets are on blackboard under course materials. Download the zip and make sure to put the files in the same directory as the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "* The lab exercises should be made in **groups of two people**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The deadline is **Tuesday 7 nov 16:59**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The assignment should submitted to **Blackboard** as `.ipynb`. Only **one submission per group**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **filename** should be `lab1_lastname1_lastname2.ipynb`, so for example `lab1_Jurafsky_Martin.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The notebook is graded on a scale of **0-10**. The number of points for each question is indicated in parantheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The questions marked **optional** are not graded; they are an additional challenge for those interested in going the extra mile. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notes on implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You should **write your code and answers in this iPython Notebook** (see http://ipython.org/notebook.html for reference material). If you have problems, please contact your teaching assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use only **one cell for code** and **one cell for markdown** answers!    \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Put all code in the cell with the `# YOUR CODE HERE` comment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * For theoretical question, put your solution in the YOUR ANSWER HERE cell.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Test your code and **make sure we can run your notebook**"

(If you are keen on learning more about the word-classes represented POS-tags and their definitions you can do a litle reading ahead for next week and already have a look at section 10.1 of the same chapter).\n",

But in the N-gram approach, increasing $n$ will quickly kill all generalizing abilities of the model: the model will start to asign probabilities only to sentences it has seen in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, where to go from here? Here are three directions that we could head in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen one example of smoothing in this lab: add-k smoothing. This is an easy method, both conceptually and implementation-wise. But the results are not great, and the effects it has on the distributions can be extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "A much more sophisticated method of smoothing is so-called **Kneser-Ney smoothing**. The method is described in detail in section 4.5 of J&M (3rd edition). This is one of the best performing N-gram smoothing methods, and up to a few years ago a popular implementation of it called [KenLM](https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/) gave state of the art results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From words to characters\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we have considered language modeling as the task of predicting a **word** $w_n$ based on a history of **words** $w_1\\cdots w_n$. What if instead we let our basic units of modelling be **characters**? The task then becomes to model $p(c_k\\mid c_{k-N-1}\\dots c_{k-1})$ where each $c_i$ is now an ASCII character instead of an entire word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly sparsity of data is no longer a problem! The set of characters to use is tiny (< 100) compared to even a small-sized vocabulary as today. Have a look at this very illustrative notebook written by Yoav Golberg to see such a method in action: [The unreasonable effectiveness of Character-level Language Models](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/yoavg/d76121dfde2618422139).\n",
    "\n",
    "(So what is the downside?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural language models\n",
    "\n",
    "The above notebook was actually written as a response to this blog post by Andrej Karpathy: [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). Go ahead and read it if you haven't already: it is a superb introduction to the topic of Recurrent Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural language models solve the problem of data sparsity in a different manner. Instead of estimating the probabilities $p(w_k\\mid w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1})$ by counting occurences in the data, they use a neural network $f_{\\theta}$ parametrized by parameters $\\theta$ to predict this probability. The parameters $\\theta$ are learned through optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest approach goes like this: each word in the history $w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1}$ is embedded separately giving  vectors $e_{k-N-1}\\dots e_{k-1}$ and then concatenated into one long vectors $[e_{k-N-1};\\dots ;e_{k-1}]$. The network then uses this history vector to predict a probability distribution over words $w$ in the vocabulary $V$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(w \\mid w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1}) = f_{\\theta}([e_{k-N-1};\\dots;e_{k-1}]).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(In order to produce legitimate probabilities the final layer of such a network will be for example a $softmax$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a solution to the sparsity problem by having the network let the individual embeddings of the words in the history interact through its non-linear transforamtion. We are letting the network figure out the smoothing itself!\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are a clever extension of this idea, where a hidden state vector $h$ is re-used and updated at each step $k$ in order to store the information of the entire history up to step $k-1$. That is, an RNN actually does away with the N-order approximation; it tries to model the full conditional directly! That means that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(w \\mid w_1\\dots w_{k-1}) \\approx RNN_{\\theta}([e_{k-1};h_{k-1}])$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the hidden state $h_{k-1}$ is a compression of the *entire history* $w_1\\dots w_{k-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great place to learn about RNNs, their problems, and solutions to those, is on the blog of [Christopher Olah](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). The project on language modelling will involve learning more about these methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "(And now, it's time to read the classic essay by Eugene Wigner that gave both of the posts their title: [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html))"

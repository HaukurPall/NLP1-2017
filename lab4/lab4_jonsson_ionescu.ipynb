    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find **collocations** with PMI.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The deadline is **Sunday 10 Dec 23:59**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The assignment should submitted to **Blackboard** as `.ipynb`. Only **one submission per group**.\n",

    "The values for $PMI$ range between minus and plus infinity. Large positive values indicate that $x$ and $y$ are strongly associated. A $PMI$ of zero means $x$ and $y$ are completely independent. And because of the logarithm, the values can also be negative, which indicates that $x$ and $y$ are co-occurring _less often_ than we would expect by chance. Negative values tend to be unreliable though, often resulting from the lack of coocurence statistics for $x$ and $y$. A more robust measure therefore is a variant of $PMI$ called the $Positive$ $PMI$:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have the $PPMI$ co-occurence matrix, we are ready to compute its **singular value decomposition (SVD)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "SVD is a very elegant linear algebra technique. It is defined as follows. Let $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$, then the singular value decomposition of A is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = U\\Sigma V^{\\top},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $U$ is an $m \\times m$ **unitary** matrix.\n",
    "    * A real-valued matrix $U$ is called unitary when $U^{\\top}U = UU^{\\top} = I$. In other words: $U$ forms an *orthonormal* basis for $\\mathbb{R}^{m}$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* $\\Sigma$ is a **diagonal** $m \\times n$ matrix with **non-negative real numbers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The diagonal values are the so called **singular values** $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2,\\dots,\\sigma_n$ (supposing $n \\leq m$). The convention is that in the matrix $\\Sigma$ these are ordered from large to small: $\\sigma_1 \\geq \\sigma_2 \\geq \\dots \\geq \\sigma_n \\geq 0$. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* $V$ is an $n \\times n$ **unitary** matrix (and $V^{\\top}$ its transpose)\n",

    "### Low-rank approximation\n",

    "\n",
    "Moreover, this approximation is the 'best' approximation of $A$ in the sense that in minimizes the distance to $A$ in a type of matrix norm called the [Frobenius norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Frobenius_norm):\n",

    "## Visualization with t-SNE\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple and rewarding way to evaluate to the word embeddings is by visualizing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When visualizing the vectors, we ideally show them in their $k$-dimensional vector space, but that is impossible to do. To plot them we need to reduce their dimension much beyond $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very popular method for this is [**t-SNE**](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/). t-SNE is a very effective technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. What it does is find a lower dimensional surface on which to project the high-dimensional data in such a way that the local structure of the original data is preserved as much as possible in the projected data. In simple words: data-points that are close to each other in the original space end up close to each other in the projected space. (Note: this does not hold large distances! Points that are far apart in the original space do not necessarily end up far apart in the projected space.) \n",
    "\n",
    "So, t-SNE is like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), another popular dimensionality reduction technique. But, due to the non-linear nature of the surface it finds (the 'manifold') t-SNE has more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "If you want to know more about t-SNE you can read the following sources:\n",
    "* [How to Use t-SNE Effectively](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/) on Distill discusses, among others, the effects of the *perplexity* parameter in t-SNE\n",
    "* This [Scikit-learn example](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/manifold/plot_t_sne_perplexity.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-manifold-plot-t-sne-perplexity-py)\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "The code plots below uses **t-SNE** to make a two-dimensional plot with our word-embeddings. We also throw in some **K-means** clustering *in the original high-dimensional space* so that we can color our dimension-reduced word-embeddings. This gives us some for additional interpretative abilities."
